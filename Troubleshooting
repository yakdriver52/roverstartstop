1. Cannot communicate with aircraft or server.

  Check power.
  Check network cabling.
  Check for proper IP address settings in config.sh compared to the output of 
  'ip address' on the machine in question.

2. Cannot log in to aircraft or server.

  Check USER settings in config.sh.
  Server username is 'gcs'.
  I do not know what the username is on the aircraft.

3. Primary drive has less than 60 minutes of video storage space (7200 MB).

  Delete old mission directories using 'rm -rf 20*'.

4. No removable drive present.

  This is a warning. The system can run without it, but we notify in case
  it had been removed and not reconnected.

5. Failed to start ROS on aircraft.

  I do not know why this would fail.

6. GStreamer Daemon is not running.

  This should only fail if gtsd hasn't been installed.

7. Failed to create a video pipeline or start video recording.

  This is rare and most commonly caused by a problem with gstreamer (network
    problems would have been detected before this).
  Run GCStop to shutdown gstreamer and then try again.
