_SET UP_

Install Gstreamer Daemon (gstd) on the server per these instructions:
https://developer.ridgerun.com/wiki/index.php?title=GStreamer_Daemon_-_Building_GStreamer_Daemon

The three computers involved (aircraft, server, and GCS) need to communicate
with each other without human involvement. To do so, they need to share
their public ssh keys with each other. On each machine, run
'ssh-keygen -b 4096'. This should only be done once and will produce an 
id_rsa.pub file in ~/.ssh that will look something like:
ssh-rsa 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 gcs@GCS-BENCH-8400
That line needs to be added to ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts file on the other two 
machines. The easiest way to do that is copying and pasting between three
terminal windows, each connected to one machine.

Edit .bashrc on the three machines and add these 3 lines at the bottom:
export ROS_MASTER_URI="http://<IP of aircraft>:11311"
export ROS_HOSTNAME=<IP of machine>
export PATH:$PATH:.
Exit the editor. Type '. .bashrc' to inherit the new settings.

Bring up QGC and go to general settings -> Video Source. Select "RTSP Video 
Stream" from the Source dropdown. Enter 
"rtsp://192.168.1.45/axis-media/media.amp" in the RTSP URL box. NOTE: The IP 
address of the encoder may be different. This only needs to be done once 
unless a different aircraft is used (the encoder IP may be different). Exit QGC.

The three desktop files need to be moved to ~/.local/share/applications on the 
GCS. Once in place, use the File Browser to navigate to that directory and drag 
them to the launcher on the left of the desktop. You will need to select
View->Show Hidden Files to see the .local directory.

Edit config.sh on GCS to match the IPs and users of the different machines. 
This only needs to be done on the GCS and it will copy it to the server and
aircraft each time GCStart is run. 

All scripts are installed on the GCS in the home directory of the versatol user.
The scripts gcstart, gcstop, videostop, systemcheck, and config.sh run on the 
GCS.
The script serverstart.sh runs on the server. It is copied into place by 
gcstart.
The script rosstart.sh runs on the vehicle companion computer. It is also 
copied into place by gcstart.


_RUNNING_

Before leaving headquarters, it is recommended to run SystemCheck to ensure
all components are in good shape. This is also run automatically in GCStart
when starting a mission.
To begin a mission, click on the GCStart icon in the launcher and follow the
instructions in the terminal. QGroundControl will be brought to the foreground 
after everything has started.
To begin recording video, return to the terminal and hit ENTER. Video can be 
stopped manually by running ./videostop or automatically when gcstop is run.
To end a mission, click on the GCStop icon in the launcher. Files will be moved 
into a directory named for the date/time at the start of the mission and the 
user will be notified when it is safe to power down or start another mission.
